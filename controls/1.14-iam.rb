  title "[#{control_abbrev.upcase}] Ensure API keys are restricted to only APIs that application needs access"

  desc 'API keys are insecure because they can be viewed publicly, such as from within a browser, or they can be accessed on a device where the key resides. It is recommended to restrict API keys to use (call) only APIs required by an application.'
  desc 'rationale', "Security risks involved in using API-Keys are below:

- API keys are a simple encrypted strings
- API keys do not identify the user or the application making the API request
- API keys are typically accessible to clients, making it easy to discover and steal an API key

Because of this Google recommend using the standard authentication flow instead.  However, there are limited cases where API keys are more appropriate. For example, if there is a mobile application that needs to use the Google Cloud Translation API, but doesn't otherwise need a back-end server, API keys are the simplest way to authenticate to that API.

In order to reduce attack surface by providing least privileges, API-Keys can be
restricted to use (call) only APIs required by an application."
