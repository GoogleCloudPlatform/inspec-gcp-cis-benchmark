  title "[#{control_abbrev.upcase}] Ensure That Compute Instances Have Confidential Computing Enabled (Automated)"

  desc "Google Cloud encrypts data at-rest and in-transit, but customer data must be decrypted for processing. Confidential Computing is a breakthrough technology that encrypts data in-use while it is being processed. Confidential Computing environments keep data encrypted in memory and elsewhere outside the central processing unit (CPU). Confidential VMs leverage hardware-based memory encryption technologies... Customer data will stay encrypted while it is used, indexed, queried, or trained on. Encryption keys are generated by and reside solely in dedicated hardware and are not exportable, enhancing isolation and security. Built-in hardware optimizations ensure Confidential Computing workloads experience minimal to no significant performance penalties."
  desc 'rationale', "Confidential Computing enables customers' sensitive code and other data encrypted in memory during processing. Google does not have access to the encryption keys. Confidential VM can help alleviate concerns about risk related to either dependency on Google infrastructure or Google insiders' access to customer data in the clear."
