  desc 'BigQuery by default encrypts the data as rest by employing Envelope Encryption using
  Google managed cryptographic keys. The data is encrypted using the data encryption
  keys and data encryption keys themselves are further encrypted using key encryption
  keys. This is seamless and do not require any additional input from the user. However, if
  you want to have greater control, Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) can be used
  as encryption key management solution for BigQuery Data Sets. If CMEK is used, the CMEK
  is used to encrypt the data encryption keys instead of using google-managed encryption
  keys.'

  For greater control over the encryption, customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) can
  be used as encryption key management solution for BigQuery tables. The CMEK is used to
  encrypt the data encryption keys instead of using google-managed encryption keys.
  BigQuery stores the table and CMEK association and the encryption/decryption is done
  automatically.
  Applying the Default Customer-managed keys on BigQuery data sets ensures that all the
  new tables created in the future will be encrypted using CMEK but existing tables need to
  be updated to use CMEK individually.'
