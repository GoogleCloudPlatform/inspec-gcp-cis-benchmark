  desc "In order to prevent unnecessarily project ownership assignments to users/serviceaccounts and further misuses of project and resources, all roles/Owner assignments should be monitored.

Members (users/Service-Accounts) with role assignment to primitive role roles/owner are Project Owners.

Project Owner has all the privileges on a project it belongs to. These can be summarized as below:

- All viewer permissions on All GCP Services part within the project
- Permissions for actions that modify state of All GCP Services within the
project
- Manage roles and permissions for a project and all resources within the
project
- Set up billing for a project

Granting owner role to a member (user/Service-Account) will allow members to modify the IAM policy. Therefore grant the owner role only if the member has a legitimate purpose to manage the IAM policy. This is because as project IAM policy contains sensitive access control data and having a minimal set of users manage it will simplify any auditing that you may have to do."
  desc 'rationale', "Project Ownership Having highest level of privileges on a project, to avoid misuse of project resources project ownership assignment/change actions mentioned should be monitored and alerted to concerned recipients.

- Sending project ownership Invites
- Acceptance/Rejection of project ownership invite by user
- Adding `role\owner` to a user/service-account
- Removing a user/Service account from `role\owner`"
