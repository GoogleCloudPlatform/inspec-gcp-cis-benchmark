  title "[#{control_abbrev.upcase}] Ensure that Cloud Storage buckets have uniform bucket-level access enabled"

  desc 'It is recommended that uniform bucket-level access is enabled on Cloud Storage buckets.'
  desc 'rationale', "It is recommended to use uniform bucket-level access to unify and simplify how you grant
access to your Cloud Storage resources.
Cloud Storage offers two systems for granting users permission to access your buckets and
objects: Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) and Access Control Lists
(ACLs). These systems act in parallel - in order for a user to access a Cloud Storage
resource, only one of the systems needs to grant the user permission. Cloud IAM is used
throughout Google Cloud and allows you to grant a variety of permissions at the bucket and
project levels. ACLs are used only by Cloud Storage and have limited permission options,
but they allow you to grant permissions on a per-object basis.

In order to support a uniform permissioning system, Cloud Storage has uniform bucket-
level access. Using this feature disables ACLs for all Cloud Storage resources: access to

Cloud Storage resources then is granted exclusively through Cloud IAM. Enabling uniform
bucket-level access guarantees that if a Storage bucket is not publicly accessible, no object
in the bucket is publicly accessible either."
