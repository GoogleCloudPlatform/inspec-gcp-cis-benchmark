  desc "Google Cloud Platform services write audit log entries to Admin Activity and Data Access logs to helps answer the questions of 'who did what, where, and when?' within Google Cloud Platform projects. Cloud Audit logging records information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the GCP services. Cloud Audit logging provides a history of AWS API calls for an account, including API calls made via the Console, SDKs, command line tools, and other GCP services."
  desc 'rationale', 'Admin activity and Data access logs produced by Cloud audit logging enables security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing. Configuring metric filter and alerts for Audit Configuration Changes ensures recommended state of audit configuration and hence, all the activities in project are audit-able at any point in time.'
