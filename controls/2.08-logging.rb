  desc 'It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for VPC network route changes.'
  desc 'rationale', "Google Cloud Platform (GCP) routes define the paths network traffic takes from a VM instance to another destinations. The other destination can be inside your VPC network (such as another VM) or outside of it. Every route consists of a destination and a next hop.  Traffic whose destination IP is within the destination range is sent to the next hop for delivery.

Monitoring changes to route tables will help ensure that all VPC traffic flows through an expected path."
