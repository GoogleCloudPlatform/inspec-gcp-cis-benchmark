  desc "A service account is a special Google account that belongs to your application or a VM, instead of to an individual end user. Your application uses the service account to call the Google API of a service, so that the users aren't directly involved. It's recommended not to use admin access for ServiceAccount."
  desc 'rationale', "Service accounts represent service-level security of the Resources (application or a VM) which can be determined by the roles assigned to it. Enrolling ServiceAccount with Admin rights gives full access to assigned application or a VM, ServiceAccount Access holder can perform critical actions like delete, update change settings etc. without the intervention of user, so It's recommended not to have Admin rights.
This recommendation is applicable only for User-Managed user created service account (Service account with nomenclature: SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com)."
