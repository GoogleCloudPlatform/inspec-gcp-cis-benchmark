  desc 'It is recommended to create sink which will export copies of all the log entries.'
  desc 'rationale', 'Log entries are held in Stackdriver Logging for a limited time known as the retention period. After that, the entries are deleted. To keep log entries longer, sink can export them outside of Stackdriver Logging. Exporting involves writing a filter that selects the log entries to export, and choosing a destination in Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or Cloud Pub/Sub.  The filter and destination are held in an object called a sink. To ensure all log entries are exported using sink ensure that there is no filter configured for a sink. Sinks can be created in projects, organizations, folders, and billing accounts.'
