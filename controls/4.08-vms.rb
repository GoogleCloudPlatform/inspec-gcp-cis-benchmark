  title "[#{control_abbrev.upcase}] Ensure Compute instances are launched with Shielded VM enabled"

  desc 'To defend against against advanced threats and ensure that the boot loader and firmware
  on your VMs are signed and untampered, it is recommended that Compute instances are
  launched with Shielded VM enabled.'
  desc 'rationale', "Shielded VMs are virtual machines (VMs) on Google Cloud Platform hardened by a set of
  security controls that help defend against rootkits and bootkits.
  Shielded VM offers verifiable integrity of your Compute Engine VM instances, so you can be
  confident your instances haven't been compromised by boot- or kernel-level malware or
  rootkits. Shielded VM's verifiable integrity is achieved through the use of Secure Boot,
  virtual trusted platform module (vTPM)-enabled Measured Boot, and integrity monitoring.
  Shielded VM instances run firmware which is signed and verified using Google's Certificate
  Authority, ensuring that the instance's firmware is unmodified and establishing the root of
  trust for Secure Boot.
  Integrity monitoring helps you understand and make decisions about the state of your VM
  instances and the Shielded VM vTPM enables Measured Boot by performing the
  measurements needed to create a known good boot baseline, called the integrity policy
  baseline. The integrity policy baseline is used for comparison with measurements from
  subsequent VM boots to determine if anything has changed.
  Secure Boot helps ensure that the system only runs authentic software by verifying the
  digital signature of all boot components, and halting the boot process if signature
  verification fails."
